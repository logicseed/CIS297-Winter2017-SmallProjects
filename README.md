Introduction to C# - CIS297 Winter 2017
======
>This repository contains two small projects in which I was tasked with creating a simulation of the
>Yahtzee game, and a simulation of the Texas Hold'em poker game. The Yahtzee game is intended to be
>single player and provide hints to the player on how they should score their roll by calculating
>the total value for each scoring category. The Texas Hold'em game is a simplified version where
>the player has a single computer opponent. After dealing the hand the computer opponent will fold
>if the odds of winning are less than 50%, otherwise it will call on the player. The player is also
>presented with their odds of winning based on the 7 known cards.
